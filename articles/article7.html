        <h1>Strangers to Ourselves by Modest Mouse</h1>

        <p>Fast. Loud. Chill. Are the words that come to mind when you hear Modest Mouse, but their newest album, Strangers to Ourselves, is different, not bad, but different. Strangers to Ourselves by Modest Mouse is their newest album, being released on March 17, 2015, being released eight years after their last album, and totals at 57 minutes and 10 seconds.</p>
        <p>Though not all the songs are as fast paced as in their album We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank, some still showed the classic Modest Mouse tune, such as "Lampshades On Fire". There are songs that just don't really seem to fit with Modest Mouse, the first song, "Strangers to Ourselves", though a good and relaxing song, just doesn't have the feeling that it's Modest Mouse.</p>
        <p>Then there's the song "Pistol", which for the first couple seconds where you can only hear the beat feels like Modest Mouse, but then the voice kicks in, and it's nothing that I've ever heard before in their songs. It's uncanny, it makes you feel sleazy and uncomfortable, like the first time you hear the album, it just doesn't feel like Modest Mouse, yet it grows on you. Even by the end of "Pistol" I was okay with it, and even liked it, and even though it wasn't classic Modest Mouse, it felt as good.</p>
        <p>By the last song, "Of Course We Know", the album feels like Modest Mouse, much like the fries you get at Wendy's, that at first are truly awful, by the end you can't stop eating them. Even though the album wasn't awful at the start, it wasn't the same, but by the end, it was good and even better at some parts. At first I would have given the album a 6/10, but after relistening to it, I just fell in love, it was amazing. After listening to it for a bit, i would give it a solid 8/10, but personally it's an album that I will listen and relisten to couple more times.</p>
