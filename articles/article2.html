        <h1>Album Review Carrie and Lowell</h1>
        <h6>By Jake Pykken</h6>

        <p>What inspires the man whose past tours have included everyone on the stage dressed up in boy scout esque uniforms and wings, everyone covered in neon body paint? At one point he planned to make an album for every state and so far has done one for Illinois and one for  Michigan, he has made multiple Christmas albums, and has covered topics from the death of a close childhood friend and the story of serial killer John Wayne Gacy.</p>
        <p>He has released an album with 26 songs, and songs with an average length of 12 words, with a 53 word song title. He lives in enigma. On March 30 Sufjan Stevens released Carrie and Lowell and gave everyone interested a glimpse into his complex childhood.</p>
        <p>The album takes around 45 minutes to listen to, and details Sufjan's life with his mother Carrie and his stepfather Lowell in Oregon. The calming tone mixed with the quiet and detailed lyrics make the listener consider what Sufjan is telling. </p>
        <p>The album is a complete shift from his previous work where he would focus on another topic and occasionally mix in personal stories such as "Casimir Pulaski Day" on the 2005 album Illinois. </p>
        <p>Mike Sparkman, a fan of Sufjan's previous work notes, "Carrie and Lowell answers a lot of questions about Sufjan that I had after hearing some of his other albums, so it's nice to be able to tie up some loose ends."</p>
        <p>The album comes after Carrie's death from stomach cancer in 2012, and Sufjan recounts her negligence, but how he still missed her. On the song "Should Have Known Better" he remembers "When I [Sufjan] was three, three maybe four she left us at that video store."</p>
        <p>He then describes how he regrets contacting her later, but how he can't change what has already happened. In the first song he says "I forgive you, mother, I can hear you and I long to be near you."</p>
        <p>Without even knowing who she is or what she has done Sufjan makes the listener feel the compassion and grief he has from the loss of his mother. He later references her drug abuse and negligent parenting, but her loss clearly strikes deep into Sufjan's heart. </p>
        <p>The whole album is filled with his melancholy, and his attempts to escape his sadness and loss. The depressed tone mixed with the quiet, acoustic, and sleepy tone of the music makes Sufjan's message only clearer.</p>
        <p>As Mike Sparkman says, "It's almost like I know him, it's such a personal album" and for such a complex person, understanding part of his life only brings more connection between the listener and Sufjan.</p>
