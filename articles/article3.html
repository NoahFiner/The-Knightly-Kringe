        <h1>Opiniated "Clash of Clans" Review</h1>
        <h6>By Zachary Mullison</h6>

        <p>Clash of clans is a progressive strategy game in which people will have to build new defenses and upgrade existing buildings in order to gain power strength and money. The currencies that are currently in the game are Elixir, Dark Elixir, Gems and Gold. The main goal of clash of clans is to progressively get a larger and harder to destroy base and go take down other bases. Not to worry, because your base cannot be permanently destroyed. I will come back and have no damage, the only thing that will be gone is a percentage of your "loot" (game currency).</p>
        <p>One of the ways in which clash of clans keeps its balance is by ranking players by skill, if you have a certain amount of trophies you will fight a player with the same if not similar number of them. I would rate clash of clans a 7/10 because when you progress to becoming a town hall 4 or town hall 5 the upgrading takes a long time. One way you can speed up your upgrades is by buying more builders in the game or spending gems which you can get from completing achievements clearing debris from your base and purchasing it from the in-app-purchases also known as the shop. </p>
