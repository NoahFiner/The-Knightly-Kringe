        <p>High school is incredibly scary for the incoming freshmen. But, from experience, the current freshmen now know that most of their previous fears were not exactly very accurate. Hopefully, the new freshmen can finally learn.</p>
        <p>"I'm a little bit nervous," said Kadin, an 8th grader at Southern Hills has one major fear about high school: the workload.</p>
        <p>The workload is known throughout incoming freshmen to be one of the largest issues and one of the most nerve-racking parts of high school.</p>
        <p>An anonymous current freshman said "Everyone had told me horror stories about how [Fairview students] stay up until 4am working on homework."</p>
	      <p>But homework isn't a large issue in the end. Usually, most students are incredibly pessimistic in middle school around the high school workload, but, according to the same anonymous freshman, the workload is "definitely less than middle school."</p>
        <p>It's agreed with almost all freshmen that they were expecting much more work in middle school than what they actually get.</p>
        <p>"It's not a lot. You still definetly have homework but it's manageable. It depends on the classes you take, it depends on the teacher, but I think it's doable," said Noah Young, a freshman.</p>
        <p>There are other questionable aspects to Fairview according to the incoming freshmen, including minimal windows and the heart rate monitors in gym.</p>
        <p>"There's some things that don't seem nice like the heart rate monitor thing in the P.E. I'm not so psyched about that," said Kadin.</p>
        <p>But also the community and atmosphere, or in other words, a first impression of the school could impress a little stress on the 8th graders. But, still, first impression isn't everything. The school's atmosphere is excellent too.</p>
        <p>"Everyone's nice to each other," Angus Fielder said.</p>
        <p>In general, high school is great. There is much more that's possible to do in it than back in middle school.</p>
        <p>"[It] seemed that there were more freedoms in high school," said Jolee, a freshman.</p>
        <p>But, there are still things to keep in mind during high school careers.</p>
        <p>"I should have done more math homework," said Braedon O'Callaghan, a freshman.</p>
        <p>"Don't procrastinate and do all your homework the day it's due," said Fielder.</p>
        <p>"Don't procrastinate," said Young.</p>
        <p>"Learn not to procrastinate. Get work done early," said Jolee.</p>
