        <h1>A Review of AM by Arctic Monkeys From Fairview</h1>
        <h6>By Michal Olesiak</h6>
        <img src="article5.jpg"/>
        <p>AM by the Arctic Monkeys is their fifth and possibly best album to be released by them, having 12 songs, totaling at 41 minutes and 43 seconds. It was recorded through March-June, 2013, and released on September 6th 2013, and by September 15th, 2013 was number one on UK Albums Chart, selling 157,329 copies. In the United States according to Billboard 200 it became number six, selling 42,000 in its first week. AM, by 2014, became Gold certified by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), selling more than 500,000 copies.</p>
        <p>All of that made AM, Arctic Monkey's most successful album, and for a good reason. All 12 of their songs have a good rhythm, that anyone can and will tap their foot to, and you might try not to, but all the songs will quickly be branded into your head.</p>
        <p>"It's definitely the album that threw them into the mainstream [for first time fans] but from the hardcore fans I've heard it is not," said Karsten Steinmeyer, a Senior and Arctic Monkeys enthusiast.</p>
        <p>According to Popmatters.com Arctic Monkey's top song is "Do I Wanna Know?", the first song in the album, a song that will make you wanting more with its beat and guitar in the background while also letting you easily sing along.</p>
        <p>The 2013 Arctic Monkey's album, AM, is simply put amazing. Though it might not have the deep meaning some search in music, it makes that up with how easy and enjoyable it is to listen to.</p>
        <p>"It's one of those albums where you love every single song and that's really rare the only other album that I've listened to so far that has done that for me is Taylor Swift's 1989 and also I listen to it I just feel so badass and it's great. Also it's a great album to make out and such to," said Steinmeyer.</p>
