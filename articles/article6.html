        <h1>NBA Playoffs Thus Far</h1>

        <p>The NBA has some of the most well known and dominant in their sport, if not the planet. Lebron James, Derrick Rose, Paul Pierce, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Blake Griffin, Kyrie Erving, Jimmy Butler, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, John Wall, James Harden, Dwight Howard, and Mike Conley highlight the last eight teams left in the tight NBA playoff race.</p>
        <p>The Eastern Conference has been known for a while as the weaker conference, and this year the bottom half of the playoff teams from the east hovered around .500 win percentage. This was very different from the Western Conference where in the last week of regular season games the 2-7 seeds changed multiple times. If the 6th seed in the west had been in the eastern conference they would have been one of the top four teams in the east.</p>
        <p>Home court advantage is very important during the playoffs because having a committed group of fans on your side is very important when trying to win four out of the seven games in each series.<p>
        <p>Even though the East has been known as the inferior conference, the second round in the east has been some of the most entertaining basketball this whole season. Five games combined in the conference semifinals determined by buzzer beaters.</p>
        <p>Paul Pierce changes three different games in the Hawks Wizards series with buzzer beaters, he wins one with a fading away bank shot from the elbow. Two others he lost because he missed a wide open three, and in the last game of the series released the ball less than a half a second too late.</p>
        <p>The Cavaliers and Bulls series was much of the same drama. Derrick Rose won a game with an off balance banked in three over two defenders as time expired, and the next game Lebron comes back and steals a game in Chicago with a deadly swished three from the corner as the buzzer went off.</p>
        <p>Daniel Person believes Lebron is the greatest of his generation, and he is probably right. Lebron has mostly carried a team that is filled with a crew of very talented players but most are inexperienced. Lebron has taken control of the Cavs the whole season and even been similar to a coach alongside David Blatt.</p>
        <p>After Lebron's shot Pearson simply stated, "Great players make great shots." Lebron has had a ridiculous playoffs, he has scored double digits in every game this playoffs, and has only sat for 8 minutes in every game except one. Lebron is so consistently good that what he does every night seems easy.

        <p>The West has been less exciting but the stacked Warriors seemed like they might have trouble with the Grizzlies, but managed to blow them out to win the series after being down early.</p>
        <p>This happened at the same time as the Rockets came back down 3-1 on the Clippers and won the series earning a conference championship berth. The Rockets will play the top seed Warriors in the Western Conference championship while the Hawks and the Cavaliers compete in the Eastern Conference championship.</p>
        <p>Pearson concluded, "I'm excited to see the conference finals. I want to see Lebron tear apart the Atlanta defense. Steph [Curry] will eat up the Rockets defense too."</p>
