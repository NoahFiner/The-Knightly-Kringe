        <h1>New PARCC Schedule Angers Students but Excites Teachers</h1>

        <p>Three weeks before the start of the April PARCC testing, the schedule was decided to be updated. PARCC testing went from occurring during math and language arts periods for students taking part in the test for a full week of block days to a normal schedule, bringing math and language arts back for all students, but forcing students taking the test to do it during their free periods up into May. Many students did not agree with the tests in general, especially the ones taking it, but most of the student body likes the new schedule less than the original ones. The teachers do prefer the newer schedule, though.</p>
        <p>A main reason that the students taking PARCC are against it is due to how it wasn't their decision to take it.</p>
        <p>"My parents did not let me refuse the PARCC," said Saketram Durbha, a freshman taking PARCC.</p>
        <p>"I didn't really have a choice in the matter because my parents kind of forced me to take it. My dad was all like 'You know, it's a really good opportunity to practice testing and if you don't take the PARCC we'll take away your computer time for six months,'" said Christian Wilson, a freshman taking PARCC.</p>
        <p>The new schedule is far less appealing to these students too.</p>
        <p>"Now I hate [the tests] even more, because now I have to give up my off periods to go do something that's pretty much worthless. They can't make me give up my off periods. It simply won't do," said Wilson.</p>
        <p>"Especially in May we're going to get a lot of more projects too. I kind of want to be able to have my off period to do work and it's really unfair for everybody who's taking PARCC and it's not just a Fairview thing," said Vikram Tholakapalli, another freshman taking PARCC.</p>
        <p>The student body not taking PARCC also agrees that it is unfair for the students taking PARCC.</p>
        <p>"I like it in the way that it's not taking away so much class time, but I don't think it's fair for the people that are taking PARCC," said Jordan Buchman, a freshman who refused PARCC.</p>
        <p>The main advantage of the schedule's change is how it allows for instruction to return.</p>
        <p>"I like the instruction time because it really helps math and science," said Ryan Chiem, a freshman who refused PARCC.</p>
        <p>"Yeah, I do like that for like math because we miss a lot of we miss that. But LA not as much," said Tholakapalli.</p>
        <p>Multiple teachers were very in favor of the instruction returning, yet still a little torn on the students who need to take PARCC, as there aren't very many that are needed accommodation now.</p>
        <p>"I don't mind [the new schedule]. I think it gives us more teaching time, which I enjoy as a teacher, but I still think that there's people who were trying to participate and are doing what they're asked to do being penalized right now," said Scott Myers, a math teacher.</p>
        <p>"It's a pretty significant minority that's actually taking the PARCC this time around and I guess it's one of those issues of weighing them vs weighing the greater good of the people. For example I had two of my classes where I had 0 students taking the PARCC, so it's sort of like why not have class?" said Jim Lewis, an LA teacher.</p>
        <p>The new schedule caused many issues for the students taking PARCC, yet bringing back teaching everyone agreed was beneficial. There seems to be no good way to do PARCC and the solutions seemed to be mixed.</p>
        <p>"I would make it an after school thing or something," said Wilson.</p>
        <p>"It would be nice if we could...change some vacation days or something just so that's there's more time in the school year to get testing," said Pfenning.</p>
        <p>But the most common opinion was that the schedule should not have changed.</p>
        <p>"I would have kept it like it was where kids got math and LA off," said Sean Martin, a freshman who refused PARCC.</p>
        <p>"I would cancel classes for a week and just do PARCC," said Durbha.</p>
        <p>"I think it should have been one or the other. So next year, if we anticipate this few people taking the test then I would say that we should go to the second set and start there and stay there. But if we think more people are going to take it...we would go back to the original schedule," said Myers.</p>
        <p>In the end, it is agreed that instruction is better than testing, but that testing during free periods is unfair should not occur. It's very difficult to rid of standardized testing though, which is highly suggested and every solution has its issues.</p>
        <p>"No matter what I would do people would get mad at me," said Buchman.</p>
